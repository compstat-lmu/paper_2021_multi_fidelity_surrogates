# Surrogates for Multi-Fidelity Problems

This package contains several surrogates that approximate the hyperparameter response surface for
several interesting machine learing algorithms across several tasks.


## Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
test = paradox::generate_design_random(ps, 1000)$data
predict_onnx(model, data = test, dicts = dicts)
```
